This template was developed to facilitate the use of the ODD protocol \autocite{grimm2006a, grimm2020} in technical and academic writing. It is based on the \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/apa7}{\texttt{apa7}} class and adheres to the formatting guidelines of the American Psychological Association (\href{https://apastyle.apa.org/}{APA}) for manuscripts and bibliographical references.

To enhance clarity, \textbf{guiding questions} are presented at the beginning of each section, with \gddarkredb{\textbf{color}}-\gddarkgreenb{\textbf{coding}} for easy reference. These questions were drawn from \autocite{grimm2010}, \autocite{grimm2020}, \autocite{muller2013}, and \autocite{railsback2019a}.

Additionally, the template includes placeholder texts with examples from \autocite{grimm2020} to further assist users, along with a visual and summarized version of the protocol, known as \textit{Visual ODD} \autocite{szangolies2024} (Figure~\ref{fig:visualodd}).

To maintain the template's general applicability, some questions from the extended ODD+D version proposed by \autocite{muller2013} were not included. Redundant questions were also removed or merged. These questions can be found in the appendix.

{
  \color{gddarkredb}
  The purpose of this model is to \textbf{explain and understand diurnal vertical migration (VM) in zooplankton and how it interacts with a life history tradeoff, the allocation of mass to reproduction or growth}. The model is based explicitly on the cladoceran Daphnia magna (which we refer to simply as Daphnia).
}

{
  \color{gddarkgreenb}
  We evaluate our model by its ability to reproduce three patterns. The first two are of primary importance because they were observed in extensive laboratory experiments by Loose and Dawidowicz (1994) and appear driven directly by the risk-growth tradeoff (Figure 5.1)...

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pattern 1: Response of VM to predation risk} \\
    This pattern reflects how daphnia VM in the laboratory changed as the perceived risk of predation by fish increased. In the laboratory experiments, perceived risk was increased by adding fish kairomones-chemicals produced by fish that daphnia can use to sense fish density and perceived risk was quantified as fish concentration (fish/L). With no perceived risk, daphnia stayed near the surface throughout the diurnal cycle. At low fish concentrations, daphnia remained near the surface or migrated only to shallow depths. With high risk, daphnia stayed near the bottom. But at intermediate risk, daphnia exhibited VM, with their mean elevation in the water column low during the day and rising toward the surface at night. And at the lowest fish concentration producing VM, daphnia did not begin migration until growing to a threshold body size.
    \item \textbf{Pattern 2: Selection of slightly shallower depths with low food} \\
    Under high perceived risk of fish predation, a decrease in food availability resulted in daphnia selecting shallower depths. However, this change in elevation was small and occurred only in daytime.
    \item \textbf{Pattern 3: Response of reproductive allocation to predation risk} \\
    Under low or absent perceived fish predation risk, the daphnia in Fiksen's model initially allocated almost all their assimilated mass to growth instead of reproduction. This allocation let them reach maximum size quickly and switch to high reproductive output. At higher risk, the daphnia allocated some mass to reproduction from the start, producing some offspring before reaching maximum size. However, at very high risk the daphnia fed very little, grew slowly, and allocated only a moderate fraction of mass to reproduction [...]

{
  \color{gddarkredb}
  The following entities are included in the model: \textbf{agents representing construction stakeholders} (i.e. awarding authorities, engineers, architects and contractors), \textbf{projects}, \textbf{grid cells} (i.e. virtual geographical location) and the \textbf{global environment representing the construction market} (i.e. construction investments and materials available).

  Awarding authorities represent private persons, companies, or public authorities awarding prime building contracts, for different purposes (e.g. personal use, economic reasons, public building requirements). Engineers represent the actors responsible for the static design of the concrete structure in buildings; architects the stakeholders designing and supervising the construction, and contractors the companies providing the concrete work... In total, 5788 agents are implemented, representing the statistical distribution of construction stakeholders in the case study. Projects represent the individual construction projects on which these agents interact... Per year about 450 projects are executed. Grid cells represent virtual construction sites of 30×30m... The observer or global environment (i.e. construction market) is the only entity on the system level, defining the annual construction investments and the potential recycling aggregates supply.

  The observer is a single entity that controls the global variables and submodels. Observer state variables (Table 1) are global variables that change over time. (Static observer variables—those that do not change over simulated time—are considered parameters and are defined with the submodels they are used in.)

  \textbf{The model's spatial extent is a square of 200×200 square cells, each 5 m × 5 m in size; hence, the total area is 100 ha}. This relatively fine resolution was chosen so the model can represent the effects of the small patches of trees and other habitat types that typify Jamaican coffee farms. The model's space is represented as bounded, not toroidal: birds at one edge of the space cannot jump to cells on the opposite edge.

  \textbf{The model runs at a 1-day time step}, except that bird habitat selection and foraging is modeled at much shorter time step during daytime hours. This "foraging time step" is a parameter forage-timestep with value of 0.0167 h (1 min). The model does not represent night; it assumes all events occur during the day. The parameter max-forage-hrs-per-day specifies how many foraging hours there are per day, assumed constant at 12. Hence, birds can move and feed up to 720 times per day.

The model is developed to cover the whole life-cycle of a stream-dwelling trout species. It is structured in nine processes: one related to the reach and cells (update of environmental and habitat conditions), five concerning trout (habitat selection, feeding and growth, survival, reproduction, and ageing) and three performed by redds (development, survival, and hatching of eggs and genetic transmission of traits to new trout).

{
  \color{gddarkcornflowerblueb}
  The reach and cells update their state variables every time step over the whole simulation; trout perform each process every time step of the simulation, but for reproduction, which only occurs during the spawning season (every time step), and angling and hooking mortality, which is restricted to the angling season (every time step); trout age every time step but change their age-class once a year (the Julian day they were born); redd's development and survival processes occur on a time-step basis since redd creation until all eggs have hatched; transmission of heritable traits occurs just when the egg hatches and the new trout is created.
}

{
  \color{gddarkredb}
  The simulation starts at an initial date set by the user through the input parameter initial-date. Environmental and habitat updates are scheduled first because subsequent trout and redd actions depend on the time step's environmental and habitat conditions. Trout actions occur before redd's because one trout action (reproduction) can cause redd mortality via superimposition. Reproduction is the first trout action because spawning can be assumed the primary activity of a fish on the day it spawns. Spawning also affects habitat selection because 1) spawners move to the spawning habitat when a redd is created and fertilized, and 2) spawners incur on weight, and thus body condition, loss after spawning, which affects their choice of habitat. Habitat selection is the second trout action each time step because it is the way that trout adapt to the new habitat conditions; habitat selection strongly affects both growth and survival. Feeding and growth precedes survival because changes in a trout's length or condition factor affect its probability of survival. Survival has its own sub-schedule because the order in which survival probabilities for the different mortality sources are evaluated strongly affects the number of trout killed by each mortality source. Widespread, less random mortality sources are scheduled first: 1) high temperature, 2) high water velocity, 3) stranding, 4) poor condition, 5) predation by terrestrial animals, 6) predation by piscivorous fish, and 7) angling and hooking. The user has the possibility of choosing which mortality sources can kill trout during the simulation and which ones are not taken into account. Redd actions occur after cell and most trout actions because redds do not affect either habitat or fish, with the exception of creating new trout, which do not execute therefore their first actions until the day after their emergence. Redd survival is the first redd action to be executed. It includes five separate egg mortality sources that follow their own sub-schedule, from least to most random: 1) low temperature, 2) high temperature, 3) scouring, 4) dewatering, 5) superimposition. Trout emergence and genetic transmission of heritable traits is the last redd action. Since survival is scheduled before emergence, trout within redds are subject to redd mortality on the day they emerge (but not to trout mortality). Trout ageing is the last agent's executed action each time step so that both pre-existent and new created trout can increase their age. Finally, observer actions (plotting graphs and writing output files) take place at the end of the time step. All actions occur in the same predetermined order:

\begin{itemize}
  \bfseries
  \item[1] Reach updates environmental and biological conditions. Cells update depth and velocity as a function of flow, and drift/search food production rate.
  \item[2] Trout reproduce:
  \item[2.1] Trout become spawners.
  \item[2.2] Trout spawn and create redds.
  \item[3]  Trout select habitat.
  \item[4] Trout feed and grow: update length, weight and body condition factor.
  \item[5] Trout survive or die.
  \item[6] Redds' eggs survive or die.
  \item[7] Redds' eggs develop.
  \item[8] Redds' eggs hatch, new trout are created and heritable traits are transmitted.
  \item[9] Trout age.
  \item[10] Observer plots model graphical outputs and write model output files.
