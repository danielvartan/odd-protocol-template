## Overview

🕹️🤖🧑‍🤝‍🧑🔄✨🌀🌍️🔎🔗🕸⏳

This repository provides a [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) template for the ODD protocol, developed by Volker Grimm et al. ([2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006002043), [2020](https://www.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4259)). It aims to facilitate the use of the ODD protocol in technical and academic writing.

The template is based on LaTeX [`apa7`](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa7) class and adheres to the formatting guidelines of the American Psychological Association ([APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/)) for manuscripts and bibliographical references.

To enhance clarity, **guiding questions** are presented at the beginning of each section, with **color-coding** for easy reference. These questions are drawn from Grimm et al. ([2010](https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.03.021), [2020](https://www.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4259)), Müller et al. ([2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.06.003)), and Railsback and Grimm ([2019](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030041673)).

Additionally, the template includes placeholder texts with examples from Grimm et al. ([2020](https://www.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4259)) to further assist users, along with a visual and summarized version of the protocol, known as *Visual ODD* (Szangolies, [2024](https://www.jasss.org/27/4/1.html)).

To maintain the template's general applicability, some questions from the extended ODD+D version proposed by Müller et al. ([2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.06.003)) were not included. Redundant questions were also removed or merged. These questions can be found in the appendix.
