## Overview

üïπÔ∏èü§ñüßë‚Äçü§ù‚ÄçüßëüîÑ‚ú®üåÄüåçÔ∏èüîéüîóüï∏‚è≥

This repository offers a [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) template for the ODD protocol, a widely used standard for structuring and documenting Agent-Based Models (ABMs), developed by Volker Grimm et al. ([2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006002043), [2020](https://www.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4259)). Designed to streamline the adoption of ODD in technical and academic writing, this template provides a structured and visually intuitive framework.

Built on the LaTeX [`apa7`](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa7) class, the template ensures compliance with the formatting guidelines of the American Psychological Association ([APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/)) for manuscripts and bibliographic references.

To enhance clarity and usability, each section begins with **guiding questions**, highlighted using **color-coding** for quick reference. These questions are drawn from key sources, including Grimm et al. ([2010](https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.03.021), [2020](https://www.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4259)), M√ºller et al. ([2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.06.003)), and Railsback & Grimm ([2019](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030041673)).

The template also includes placeholder texts with examples from Grimm et al. ([2020](https://www.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4259)) to assist users in structuring their models. Additionally, it features a concise, visual summary of the protocol‚Äî*Visual ODD* (Szangolies, [2024](https://www.jasss.org/27/4/1.html))‚Äîfor an alternative, more intuitive representation.

To keep the template broadly applicable, some elements from the extended ODD+D version proposed by M√ºller et al. ([2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.06.003)) were omitted. Redundant or overlapping questions were consolidated. These missing questions remains available in the appendix.
